This is a simple shell script that downloads all the lecture videos of ai-class automatically.

It uses this: https://gist.github.com/1282440 python code which downloads one video at a time.
In order to use this script make sure to download the python code and place it with download.sh
You may need to make download.sh executable by typing "chmod 755 download.sh"
After that just run the script: "./download.sh"

BTW, this is one of my first shell scripts to make the downloading automatic. 
That is, I know this is a very simple script but it helped me and I hope it will help others as well.

Have fun!
